Instead, individuals (SAMPRULE=4) or related groups (SAMPRULE=3) were sampled from these large households; in these cases, NUMPERHH will show how big the entire household was. See SAMPRULE and "Sample Designs" for a discussion of differences in how the samples were drawn.

User note: Because of data entry errors in a small number of large and complex households, NUMPERHH was occasionally entered as less than NUMPREC--a logical impossibility.  Correcting these data would be prohibitively difficult, and NUMPERHH has been coded as missing (9999) for these cases.  However, visual inspection of these households suggests that DWSIZE is a reasonable approximation of true NUMPERHH values where stated NUMPERHH values are illogical.

  <txt><![CDATA[HHTYPE is a constructed variable that mirrors the household type variable that the Census Bureau created in its 2000 PUMS sample (see page 6-37 of the 2000 PUMS codebook).  With HHTYPE, the IPUMS creates the variable consistently from 1940 onward.  A future version of this variable will provide the same categories for all IPUMS samples.

HHTYPE classifies all households as either family or nonfamily households.  Family households are distinguished from nonfamily households using RELATE.  A family household consists of a household head and one or more persons who are related to the household head by birth, marriage, or adoption and who are living together in the same household.  According to the household head's SEX and MARST, family households are classified as either a married-couple family or a family headed by a man/woman without a spouse present.  Family households with no spouse present include household heads of all marital statuses except married, spouse present (see MARST).  Households where an unmarried partner is present are classified as family households only if there are other persons in the household who are related to the household head by birth, marriage, or adoption.  Therefore, households containing only a household head and an unmarried partner are coded as nonfamily households.  Nonfamily households are distinguished by the sex of the household head and the presence of other unrelated individuals (including partners) living in the household.]]></txt>

State or territory names represent that state or territory's contemporary political boundaries for a given year. Users should familiarize themselves with any historical changes in these boundaries that might affect their research. (Go here for year-by-year maps of states and territories in the U.S.) IPUMS assigns current state codes to territories that later became states; for example, Arizona Territory in 1880 and 1900 is given the Arizona state code (61). In 1880, Dakota Territory counties are split between areas that ultimately became North and South Dakota.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[IPUMS USA cannot identify most counties in recent samples. 

COUNTYICP identifies the county where the household was enumerated, using the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) coding scheme.

COUNTYICP codes are state-dependent; they must be combined with state codes (see STATEICP or STATEFIP) to distinguish counties located in different states.

Many county boundaries and some county names have changed over time. IPUMS does not impose a uniform county boundary system on the data, so each county listed for a given year in IPUMS should be assumed to have the boundaries that it had in that year.

All counties are identified in 1850 to 1950 full count files. Counties are not identified in public-use microdata samples from 1950 onwards, so IPUMS instead identifies counties, where possible, from other low-level geographic identifiers. These include State Economic Areas (SEA) in the 1950 1% sample; county groups in 1970 samples (CNTYGP97) and 1980 samples (CNTYGP98); and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA) from 1990 onwards, including Super-PUMAs (PUMASUPR) in 2000.

In 1950 and later samples (excluding the 1950 full count), COUNTYICP identifies a county if and only if:

it was coterminous with a single SEA, county group, or PUMA; or

it contained multiple SEAs, county groups, or PUMAs, none of which extended into other counties.
List of counties identified in 1950 and later samples: 

Identified Counties, 1950-Forward
For municipios, the Puerto Rican statistical equivalent of U.S. counties, see PRCOUNTA (alphabetic version) and PRCOUNTY (numeric version).

ICPSR county codes are generally ordered alphabetically by county name within states. With a few exceptions, ICPSR codes correspond to 3-digit FIPS codes (as identified by COUNTYFIP) followed by an added zero digit. The fourth digit is used to accommodate the complete history of U.S. County definitions. FIPS codes were instituted around the time of the 1970 census, and historical counties that were dissolved before then have no FIPS code. For such counties, ICPSR generally appends a fourth digit of 5.

Like STATEICP, COUNTYICP facilitates merging IPUMS data with ICPSR data. COUNTYICP also identifies areas that were not part of any county, including the independent cities of Virginia and some Indian lands.

In multi-year ACS/PRCS samples that span different PUMA definitions, this variable is based on whichever PUMA definition is associated with the respondent's survey year (as given by MULTYEAR). This occurs only in the 2022 5-year samples and in multi-year samples that include both 2011 and 2012 survey years. For more information about how PUMA definitions vary within multi-year samples, see the PUMA variable description.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[SIZEPL is a recode of CITYPOP, grouping places of similar sizes. See CITY and CITYPOP for further description and discussion of comparability issues. As with most of the location variables, confidentiality restrictions currently in effect for samples from 1950 forward, and previously in effect when some geographic variables were created for 1940, limit the identifiable places beginning in 1940. The second digit of SIZEPL, which classifies places of less than 100,000 population, is usually only applicable to the pre-1940 samples. (Some cities under 100,000 are identified in 1940 and 1950, if their population was 100,000 in 1980).]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[URBAN indicates whether a household's location was urban or rural. It is one of the most used geographic variables and one of the most problematic. Definitions of "urban" vary from year to year - see the background and comparability sections - but the term generally denotes all cities and incorporated places of 2,500+ inhabitants. (All areas not classified as urban are designated rural.) 

Background:
The Census Office first used an urban definition of 8,000 or more inhabitants in the 1880 census, and provided a tabulation of the number of places designated as urban and the size of urban population back to 1790. Beginning in 1910, the Census Bureau defined as urban population "that residing in cities and other incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more, including New England towns of that size." The Bureau went on to note that in most regions, densely populated areas of 2,500 are set off from rural territory and incorporated as municipalities (cities, towns, villages, boroughs, etc.). In New England, however, it was not typically the practice to set off densely populated areas from towns (townships) as cities unless they obtained a population of ten thousand or more. Although many New England towns were distinctly rural throughout and others contained densely populated areas, the Census Bureau considered all towns of 2,500 or more inhabitants as urban. The urban population in New England, therefore, included some individuals which, in other regions, would be designated as living in rural areas. Since most New England towns of 2,500 or more were densely population, however, the Bureau argued that the definition did not greatly exaggerate the urban population.

In 1920 the Census Bureau modified their treatment of the New England States of Connecticut, Maine, and Vermont by only considering incorporated municipalities with a population of at least 2,500 as urban for those states. In 1930, the Census Bureau slightly modified and extended the definition of urban. Although still, for the most part, comprised of cities and incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more, the 1930 census returns also considered townships and other political subdivisions (not incorporated as municipalities) having a total population of 10,000 or more, and a population density of 1,000 or more per square mile, as urban. The extension added to the urban group 11 townships in New Jersey, 10 townships in Pennsylvania, 4 towns in Connecticut, 2 townships in California, and 1 town in New York that would have been considered rural under the 1920 definition. The aggregate population of these 28 places was 573,329. In the three New England states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, the Census Bureau modified their prior practice of classifying all towns of 2,500 or more inhabitants as urban, since it was now believed to include a considerable number of places that were mainly rural in their general characteristics. The new special rule was to consider as urban "in addition to the regularly incorporated cities" only those towns in which there was a village or thickly settled area having more than 2,500 inhabitants and comprising, either by itself or when combined with other villages within the same town, more than 50 percent of the total population of the town. As a result, 12 towns in New Hampshire, 56 towns in Massachusetts, and 8 towns in Rhode Island were considered rural that would have been considered urban under the 1920 definition. The aggregate population of these 76 towns was 288,621.

The 1940 Census Bureau maintained the urban definition used by the 1930 Census Bureau. Under the special rules maintained for New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, 102 towns were designated as urban (7 in New Hampshire, 83 in Massachusetts, and 12 in Rhode Island). Significantly for the creation of the IPUMS samples, the 1940 Census Bureau applied the definition to earlier census years (a practice the 1910 Census Bureau judged "extremely difficult, if at all possible" in censuses before 1880), and reported the urban-rural population by state between 1790 and 1940. Although it is unclear how accurately the 1930 definition could have been applied to census returns, the urban series produced by the 1940 Census Bureau is the only attempt to create a comparable urban-rural definition across time and is commonly cited by historians.

In 2002, the IPUMS project obtained a transcription of the places and their urban population used by the 1940 Census Bureau to construct their historical series. All IPUMS samples for the censuses before 1950 employ the 1930-1940 definition of urban.]]></txt>

  <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[FAMUNIT indicates to which family within the housing unit each person belongs. If there is only one group of related individuals, all of them will be coded 1; if there is a second, separate such group, all members of that family group will be coded 2, and so on. All persons with a RELATE code less than 1100 are included in FAMUNIT, coded as 1. It is possible for an individual with a RELATE code larger than 1100 to be included in the "primary family" if they are identified as a child or spouse of a primary family member using SPLOC, MOMLOC, or POPLOC.

The Census Bureau defines "primary families" as groups of persons related to the head of household, and "primary individuals" as household heads/householders residing without kin. In the IPUMS, primary families and primary individuals are identified in FAMUNIT with a code of 1; each secondary family or secondary individual receives a higher code. Note that IPUMS primary families (FAMUNIT=1) may also include individuals that the Census Bureau does not consider to be in the primary family if they are linked to someone related to the household head by SPLOC, MOMLOC, or POPLOC. For example, IPUMS links unmarried partners of the head to the household head using SPLOC and so these partners will be included in the IPUMS primary family unit, but because they are not related by blood or marriage to the household head, they will not be included in the Census Bureauâs primary family unit. To recreate the Census Bureauâs definition of the primary family, users can select only those individuals in the IPUMS primary family whose RELATE value is less than or equal to 1100.

  <labl>Mother's location in the household</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[MOMLOC is a constructed variable that indicates whether the person's mother lived in the same household and, if so, gives the person number of the mother (PERNUM). The method by which probable child-mother links are identified is described in MOMRULE for samples from 1970 to present and in MOMRULE_HIST for samples prior to 1970.

MOMLOC makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of children and their (probable) mothers. 

In 2017, the family interrelationship variables for samples from 1970 to present were revised to increase comparability across IPUMS projects and include same-sex couples. Many researchers who are familiar with the previous version of family interrelationship variables will find it useful to read a brief overview of the key differences of the  New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables. On this page you'll find information on how family interrelationship variables are constructed, common uses of these variables, and specific examples of how these variables can be used efficiently.

Samples prior to 1970 continue to use the original version of family interrelationship variables.

User Caution: MOMLOC identifies social relationships (such as stepmother and adoptive mother) as well as biological relationships. For 1970 and later, MOMLOC will also identify the unmarried partner of a child's father identified with POPLOC
If the person identified with MOMLOC has a spouse or partner identified through SPLOC, the spouse or partner will also be identified as a parent through POPLOC (if a different-sex couple) or MOMLOC2 (if a same-sex couple). POPRULE  and MOM2RULE will communicate the method through which those relationships are identified.  

The original version of MOMLOC and other IPUMS pointer variables are available for 1970 to present here.]]></txt>

  <labl>Probable step/adopted mother</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[USER CAUTION: The STEPMOM and STEPPOP variables are currently being re-developed for samples 1970 and later. 

STEPMOM reports whether a person's mother, as identified by MOMLOC, was likely to have been the person's stepmother or adoptive mother. Non-zero values of STEPMOM explain why it is probable that the person's mother was a step- or adoptive mother. A value of 0 indicates no likely stepmother because (1) the mother identified in MOMLOC was probably the biological mother or (2) there was no mother of this person present in the household. The IPUMS assumes that the mother is the biological mother if she is (1) the householder and reported the child to be her son/daughter, or (2) the wife of the householder, who reported the child to be his son/daughter. For 1850-1870, MOMLOC (and thus STEPMOM) is based on imputed relationship (IMPREL), rather than on RELATE.

For the 1940-1980 censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS the category "son/daughter" included adopted and/or step-children as well as biological children (see RELATE). The 1990 form distinguished stepchildren; the 2000 census form distinguished both stepchildren and adopted children. Thus, the capacity to identify stepmothers and adoptive mothers varies across years. Overall, many stepmothers and adoptive mothers in the population cannot be identified with the information available, and STEPMOM always under-represents their actual number in the population. See MOMRULE and "Family Interrelationships" for more information.

The following codes are included in STEPMOM:
0 = 	Biological mother or no mother of this person present in household. 
1 = 	Age difference between mother and child was less than 12 or greater than 54 years. 
2 = 	Link was established only because the mother was married to the father (according to SPLOC). The listed order of family members on the form was non-standard. 
3 = 	Form explicitly identified as stepmother - information not available for 1960, 1970, 1980, the ACS, and the PRCS.
4 = 	Mother had 0 children surviving. 
5 = 	Form explicitly identified as adopted - information available only for the 1880, 1900, 1910 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), 1920 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), and 2000 (U.S. and Puerto Rican) censuses.
6 = 	Child was older than the mother's marriage (current marriage for 1900 and 1910, first marriage for 1960 and 1970), and the mother's response in BPL did not match the child's response in MBPL. 
7 = 	If the number of children linked to each mother exceeded the number of children born or the number of children surviving (whichever is valid), the IPUMS unlinked the eldest child(ren) with the same surname, unless the mother was listed as wife and the child was listed as a stepchild of the head.

If a link could be made according to more than one rule, the lowest-numbered rule was applied.]]></txt>

  <labl>Rule for linking mother</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[MOMRULE_HIST reports why the IPUMS variable MOMLOC linked the person to a probable mother prior to 1970. The IPUMS establishes mother-child links according to seven basic rules, and MOMRULE_HIST reports the number of the rule for the link in question. If a link could be made according to more than one rule, the lowest-numbered rule was applied. See also MOMLOC, STEPMOM, "Family Interrelationships", and New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables for more information. 

The following codes are included in MOMRULE_HIST: 

0 = No mother of this person present in the household. 

1 = Unambiguous relationship, based upon relationships to the head of household as listed on the form (see RELATE), or based on imputed relationship (IMPREL) for 1850-1870. This covers three basic cases: 

a) a person listed as a son or daughter is linked to a person listed as wife/spouse or female head.

b) a person listed as head, brother, or sister is linked to a person listed as mother. 

c) a person listed as wife, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law is linked to a person listed as mother-in-law.
2 = Persons listed as grandchildren are linked to the most proximate preceding (on the form) ever-married daughter, unmarried daughter (if immediately followed by a grandchild), or daughter-in-law of the head, if the daughter/daughter-in-law is 11-59 years older than the grandchild. If no link is formed with a preceding female, the program looks for the most proximate subsequent female who satisfies the same criteria. 

3 = Other persons are linked to any preceding ever-married female who is 15-49 years older, so long as: 

a) the two persons have listed (or imputed, for 1850-1870) relationships to the head that, when compared with one another, make a child-mother link plausible,

b) there are no persons listed between the potential child and mother, except the potential mother's other children or husband, and
4 = Same as rule 3, but surname similarity overrides part b of rule 3. If more than one potential mother is found in this way, the most proximate preceding female is linked. This rule can be applied only to samples with surname codes: 1850 to 1950. 

5 = Same as rule 2, except evidence on children-ever-born (or children surviving for 1900 and 1910) overrides the potential mother's lack of "ever-married" status. This rule can be applied only to samples with children-ever-born or children surviving information: the 1900, 1910 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), and 1960. 

6 = Same as rule 3, except evidence on children-ever-born (or children surviving for 1900 and 1910) overrides the potential mother's lack of "ever-married" status. Like rule 5, this rule can be applied only to the 1900, 1910 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), and 1960.

7= If the child is already linked to a father (see POPLOC and POPRULE), and that father has a wife present in the household who has not been linked to the child by another rule, the wife is linked to the child as a stepmother, regardless of the age gap between child and the stepmother. 

The IPUMS performs the following consistency checks: 

If a husband and wife were both linked to the same mother, the IPUMS chose the best mother link based on detailed relationship, surname, and proximity within the household, as listed on the form.

If both parents were present but they were not married to each other, the IPUMS unlinked the mother if her surname did not match that of the child. For years that lack surname (the 1960 Censuses), the least proximate parent was unlinked (i.e., was presumed not to be the biological parent).

  <txt><![CDATA[POPLOC is a constructed variable that indicates whether the person's father lived in the same household and, if so, gives the person number of the father (PERNUM). The method by which probable child-father links are identified is described in POPRULE for samples from 1970 to present and in POPRULE_HIST for samples prior to 1970. 

POPLOC makes it easy for researchers to link the characteristics of children and their (probable) father. 

In 2017, the family interrelationship variables for samples from 1970 to present were revised to increase comparability across IPUMS projects and include same-sex couples.  Many researchers who are familiar with the previous version of family interrelationship variables will find it useful to read a brief overview of the key differences of the New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables. On this page you'll find information on how family interrelationship variables are constructed, common uses of these variables, and specific examples of how these variables can be used efficiently.

Samples prior to 1970 continue to use the original version of family interrelationship variables.

User Caution: POPLOC identifies social relationships (such as stepfather and adoptive father) as well as biological relationships. For 1970 and later, POPLOC will also identify the unmarried partner of a child's mother identified with MOMLOC
If the person identified with POPLOC has a spouse or partner identified through SPLOC, the spouse or partner will also be identified as a parent through MOMLOC (if a different-sex couple) or POPLOC2 (if a same-sex couple). MOMRULE  and POP2RULE will communicate the method through which those relationships are identified.

  <labl>Probable step/adopted father</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[USER CAUTION: The STEPMOM and STEPPOP variables are currently being re-developed for samples 1970 and later. 

STEPPOP indicates whether a person's father, as identified by POPLOC, was likely to have been the person's stepfather or adoptive father. Non-zero values of STEPPOP explain why it is probable that the person's father was a step- or adoptive father. A value of 0 indicates no likely stepfather because (1) the father identified in POPLOC was probably the biological father or (2) there was no father of this person present in the household. The IPUMS assumes that the father is the biological father if he is (1) the householder and reported the child to be his son/daughter, or (2) the husband of the householder, who reported the child to be her son/daughter. For 1850-1870, POPLOC (and thus STEPPOP) is based on imputed relationship (IMPREL), rather than on RELATE.

For the 1940-1980 censuses and the ACS, the category "son/daughter" included adopted and/or stepchildren as well as biological children (see RELATE). The 1990 form distinguished stepchildren; the 2000 census form distinguished both stepchildren and adopted children. Thus, the capacity to identify stepfathers and adoptive fathers varies across years. Overall, many stepfathers and adoptive fathers cannot be identified with the information available, and STEPPOP always underrepresents their actual number in the population. See POPRULE and "Family Interrelationships" for more information.   

The following codes are included in STEPPOP:
0 =  	Biological father or no father of this person present in household.
1 = 	Age difference between father and child was less than 14 years.
2 = 	Link was established only because the father was married to the mother (according to SPLOC). The listed order of family members on the form was non-standard.
3 = 	Form explicitly identified as stepfather - information not available for 1960, 1970, 1980, and the ACS.
5 = 	Form explicitly identified as adopted - information available only for the 1880, 1900, 1910 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), 1920 (U.S. and Puerto Rican), and 2000 (U.S. and Puerto Rican) censuses.
6 = 	Child was older than the father's marriage (current marriage for 1900 and 1910, first marriage for 1960 and 1970), and the father's response in BPL did not match the child's response in FBPL.
7 = 	Surname differed, and child was a male, a never-married female (1880), or a female under age 15 (1850-1870).

If a link could be made according to more than one rule, the lowest-numbered rule was applied.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[POPRULE_HIST reports why the IPUMS variable

                POPLOC

                linked the person to a probable father for samples prior to 1970. IPUMS establishes father-child links according to five basic rules, and POPRULE_HIST reports the number of the rule for the link in question. If a link could be made according to more than one rule, the lowest-numbered rule was applied. See also POPLOC,

                STEPPOP

                ,

                "Family Interrelationships"

                , and

                New IPUMS Family Interrelationship Variables

                for more information. 

The following codes are included in POPRULE_HIST: 

0 = 	No father of this person present in household.

1 = 	Unambiguous relationship, based upon relationships to the head of household as listed on the form (see

                RELATE

                ), or based on imputed relationship (

                IMPREL

                ) for 1850-1870. This covers three basic cases:

                

a) a person listed as a son or daughter is linked to the person listed as the head or the spouse of the female head. 

b) a person listed as head, brother, or sister is linked to the person listed as father. 

c) a person listed as wife, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law is linked to a person listed as father-in-law.
                2 = 	Persons listed as grandchildren are linked to the most proximate preceding (on the form) ever-married son, an unmarried son (if immediately followed by the grandchild), or son-in-law of the head, if the son/son-in-law is 15-79 years older than the grandchild. If no link is formed with a preceding male, the program looks for the most proximate subsequent male who satisfies these criteria. 

3 = 	Other persons are linked to any preceding ever-married male who is 15-64 years older, so long as:

                

a) the two persons have listed (or imputed, for 1850-1870) relationships to the head that, when compared with one another, make a child-father link plausible, 

b) there are no persons listed between the potential child and father, except the potential father's other children or wife, and
                4 = 	Same as rule 3, but surname similarity overrides the second part of rule 3. If more than one potential father is found in this way, the most proximate preceding male is linked. This rule can be applied only to samples with surname codes: 1850 to 1950.

7 = 	If the child is already linked to a mother (see

                MOMLOC

                and

                MOMRULE

                ), and that mother has a husband present in the household who has not been linked to the child by another rule, the husband is linked to the child as a stepfather, regardless of the age gap between the child and the stepfather.

The IPUMS performs the following consistency checks:

                

If the child was linked to a father and mother who were not married to one another, the IPUMS unlinked the father. If a husband and wife were both linked to the same father, the IPUMS chose the best parental link, based on detailed relationship, surname, and proximity within the household, as listed on the form.

If both parents were present but they were not married to each other, the IPUMS unlinked the father if his surname did not match that of the child. For years that lack surname information (the 1960 Census), the least proximate parent was unlinked (i.e., was presumed not be the biological parent).

  <labl>Relationship to household head [general version]</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[RELATE describes an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder. Beginning in 1880, data on household relationship was asked of every person. The general relationship code is reasonably comparable across years. The detailed code makes distinctions that cannot be made in all years.

The relationship codes are divided into two categories: relatives (codes 1-10) and non-relatives (codes 11-13). In general, the codes for relatives are self-explanatory. The non-relative codes are divided into three groups: "Partner, Friend, Visitor," roughly described as persons who do not pay or work for their accommodations (unless they share ownership); "Other Non-Relatives," including those persons paying or working for accommodations; and "Institutional Inmates." See the comparability discussion for further information about the coding scheme.

RELATE is not available for 1850-1870, but the IPUMS variable IMPREL produces similar results.  As a convenience, the extract system is set up so that users may include RELATE in extracts of the 1850-1870 samples.  In those years, RELATE contains the information that is documented in the IMPREL variable description.]]></txt>

  <labl>Imputed relationship to household head</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[IMPREL reports the person's imputed relationship to the head of household. The variable was created for the 1850-1870 samples because these censuses did not collect the explicit family interrelationship information available for all other years (see RELATE). IMPREL relationships are the result of logical inference and statistical imputation, not direct transcriptions from the census forms. IMPREL is constructed in identical fashion for 1880 as well, to facilitate comparisons.

The most important IMPREL determinants are the order in which names appeared on the census form, surname similarity, age, sex, occupation, and birthplace. For about 75 percent of cases, the IPUMS assigns IMPREL according to logical rules based upon these determinants. For the remaining cases, the IPUMS uses a hot deck allocation procedure that examines a wider set of determinants to probabilistically assign IMPREL. See "Family Interrelationships" for more information.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. 

Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded. Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing RACE and HISPAN in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. More improvements made to the race question in 2020 were implemented in 2023. See the comparability tab for more details. 

IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACHSING. RACHSING codes race and Hispanic origin responses into a simple, historically compatible scheme that includes only federally defined race and Hispanic origin groups. Please note that RACESING, an earlier version of RACHSING, is also available on the IPUMS website. 

In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. 

Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.

User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.]]></txt>

Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. 

Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded. Beginning in 2020, the Census Bureau updated the questionnaire text, processing, and coding of the race and Hispanic origin questions, resulting in major changes to the distribution of race and Hispanic origin categories. As a result, users should proceed with caution when comparing RACE and HISPAN in 2019-prior samples with 2020-onward samples. More improvements made to the race question in 2020 were implemented in 2023. See the comparability tab for more details. 

IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACHSING. RACHSING codes race and Hispanic origin responses into a simple, historically compatible scheme that includes only federally defined race and Hispanic origin groups. Please note that RACESING, an earlier version of RACHSING, is also available on the IPUMS website. 

In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. 

Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.

User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.]]></txt>

  <labl>Occupation, 1950 basis</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[Universe Note: "New Workers" are persons seeking employment for the first time, who had not yet secured their first job.

OCC1950 applies the 1950 Census Bureau occupational classification system to occupational data, to enhance comparability across years. For pre-1940 samples created at Minnesota, the alphabetic responses supplied by enumerators were directly coded into the 1950 classification. For other samples, the information in the variable OCC was recoded into the 1950 classification. Codes above 970 are non-occupational responses retained in the historical census samples or blank/unknown. The design of OCC1950 is described at length in " Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS.". The composition of the 1950 occupation categories is described in detail in U.S. Bureau of the Census,   Alphabetic Index of Occupations and Industries: 1950   (Washington D.C., 1950). 

In 1850-1880, any laborer with no specified industry in a household with a farmer is recoded into farm labor. In 1860-1900, any woman with an occupational response of "housekeeper" enters the non-occupational category "keeping house" if she is related to the head of household. Cases affected by these imputation procedures are identified by an appropriate data quality flag. 

A parallel variable called OCC1990, available for the samples from 1950 onward, codes occupations into a simplified version of the 1990 occupational coding scheme.]]></txt>

The variables SERIAL and PERNUM uniquely identify individuals within a dataset. However, the specific respondents associated with those unique values can change as historical full count datasets are improved. HISTID allows researchers to track specific individuals regardless of any such changes as it is a unique identifier independent of household and position within household. Researchers can then merge their existing data with newer versions of the data file using HISTID and identify updates, corrections, or improvements that may have been applied to the data.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[HIK is a universal identifier key used to track individuals across historical censuses.

HIKs are the product of a complex linking process developed by the Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (MLP) project. The MLP project and a description of the linking process are described at the Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel home page.

Individuals can be linked across time spans as long as 80 years. The linking process matches records across 10, 20, and 30 year census pairs, and these links are then chained together into a single HIK. Because the constituent links include non-adjacent censuses, the chain of links within a HIK can skip over ten and twenty years gaps in which we were unable to identify an individual.

We expect to continue improving the linking algorithm in the coming years, applying new data and techniques. If the relationship between any of the person identifiers (HISTIDs) and a HIK change, the old HIK will be permanently discarded and a new HIK will be generated. Old (obsolete) HIKs will be archived and made available for download. The variable VERSIONHIK indicates the revision number of the census data and the MLP linking database; users working with older versions of the data should be mindful that changes to HIKs can occur with the release of revised data. Please refer to the comparability tab for a discussion of the differences between versions of the MLP linking data.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[HIK is a universal identifier key used to track individuals across historical censuses.

HIKs are the product of a complex linking process developed by the Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel (MLP) project. The MLP project and a description of the linking process are described at the Multigenerational Longitudinal Panel home page.

Individuals can be linked across time spans as long as 80 years. The linking process matches records across 10, 20, and 30 year census pairs, and these links are then chained together into a single HIK. Because the constituent links include non-adjacent censuses, the chain of links within a HIK can skip over ten and twenty years gaps in which we were unable to identify an individual.

We expect to continue improving the linking algorithm in the coming years, applying new data and techniques. If the relationship between any of the person identifiers (HISTIDs) and a HIK change, the old HIK will be permanently discarded and a new HIK will be generated. Old (obsolete) HIKs will be archived and made available for download. The variable VERSIONHIK indicates the revision number of the census data and the MLP linking database; users working with older versions of the data should be mindful that changes to HIKs can occur with the release of revised data. Please refer to the comparability tab for a discussion of the differences between versions of the MLP linking data.]]></txt>
